<h2> ROLL THE BALL GAME </h2> 
OVERVIEW: <br> 
This project is a 3D orthographic game made using Unity and C#. <br> 
The goal of the game is to navigate a ball through various obstacles while collecting items. <br> 
This project includes most basic concepts of Unity and C# script, like moving objects, collision detectors, camera view manipulation, and UI elements. <br> <br>

FEATURES: <br> 
Player movement: The user uses his keyboard to control the movement of the ball while it navigates through the game environment. <br>
Camera Follow: Dynamic following of the player's character through camera view during the game. <br> 
Collectibles: Hearts scattered across the level for increased score points. <br> 
Obstacles: Obstacles like 'danger sign' challenge the player and make the game difficult for him/her. <br>
User Interface: A UI system is added for tracking the player's score, his health etc. <br> 
Sound Effects: Integration of sound effects with collectibles, winning, and collision of the player with obstacles. <br>

(Open the Project, taking into consideration that Unity should be installed on your machine) <br>

GETTING STARTED: After the project opens in Unity, press the Play button. <br>

HOW TO PLAY: <br> 
Movement: The arrow keys or WASD keys are used for moving the ball around the level. <br> 
Objective: Collect all the hearts, then only you would win. <br> 
Winning: When all the collectibles have been gathered, the "You Win" screen will pop up. <br> 
Losing: When your health goes to zero by hitting obstacles or if the time runs out, a "You Lose" pop-up appears, giving you an option to restart the level or exit. <br> 

PROJECT STRUCTURE: <br> 
Assets: Includes all game assets like, textures, scripts etc. <br> 
Scenes: This includes all the scenes used in the game. <br>
Scripts: Includes C# scripts controlling game logic, movement of players, behavior of cameras, and interaction with UI. <br>
